# STFC-Work-Experience-Project
Various small test projects using `Docker`, `Docker Compose`, `Graylog` and the `logging` and `graypy` libraries.

Main project with the ISIS Experiment Controls Group can be found at https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/genie_python/pull/336, working with Jack Harper to log commands run through IBEX to a central Graylog server.
